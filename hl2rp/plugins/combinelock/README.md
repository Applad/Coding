Requirements
=========

None, absolutely none

How to use
=========

You must be able to spawn entities!
Now, browse to the entities tab "HL2 RP"
The new entity "Union Lock" is there. Upon spawning, it will save it's position and all others on the map.
Simply look at a door you want a lock on and spawn in the lock. You can then spawn a lock on the other side of the door.
The 2 locks on the door know that eachother exists, so when they both unlock and lock.
Edit the function "CanUseComLock" in sh_plugin.lua to allow different people to use the locks.
