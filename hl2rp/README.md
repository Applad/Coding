## Half-Life 2 Roleplay ##

Half-Life 2 Roleplay is role-play based off the Half-Life 2 game from Valve. The gamemode comes with the standard features you would expect from any ordinary Half-Life 2 Roleplay server. The only difference is some of the *new* features (listed below), it is *free*, and for the NutScript framework (which is also free for [download here](https://github.com/Chessnut/NutScript)).

You can view more information regarding the gamemode, which includes the features and pictures/videos of the gamemode, on the [Facepunch thread](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1339163).
